CryptoProfiteer
==========

About
-----
This project consumes CSV fills reports from Coinbase and allows me (and my wife) to plan tax impact and profit/loss of historical and proposed crypto transactions.

This project avoids using npm or nodejs because I'm sick of hijacked npm accounts and unsafe package updates.

This project avoids using HTTPS because I'm sick of dealing with certificates at work.

This project doesn't have any unit tests because I don't pay me enough to write them for my personal projects.
