CryptoProfiteer
==========

About
-----
This project consumes CSV fills reports from Coinbase and Kucoin, allowing me to track tax impact and profit/loss of historical crypto transactions.

This project avoids using npm or nodejs because I'm sick of hijacked npm accounts and unsafe package updates.

This project avoids using HTTPS because I'm sick of dealing with certificates at work.

This project doesn't have any unit tests because I don't pay me enough to write them for my personal projects.

Building
--------
Download .NET Core 7 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/
Do `dotnet run` to compile and run the project. A web browser is launched at http://localhost:5000 - enjoy the ride.
