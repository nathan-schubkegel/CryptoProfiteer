This is a great camera, and I am happy with it. Mic sound is a little fuzzy sometimes, 
but on the computer it sounds perfect. I took a video of my brother jumping off the bed 
in slow mode one time, and it turned out really well! I definitely recommend this camera! 
It takes surprisingly good pictures too.
